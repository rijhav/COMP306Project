# COMP306Project
For this project I was required to build a Java database application for a business scenario designed by myself. I decided to build a database management system for a 
car company, which manufactures and sells cars, that aided the owner in automating some of the business processes. The application allowed the user to create a new 
record in the database, delete an existing record from the database and display 3 reports of significant complexity based on the records stored in the database. 
We had to define our own business scenario for the project. We then had to create an ER model and translate it to a relational schema in the 3rd normal form. 
We then had to construct the database. Using the relational schema, we were required to create the SQL files needed to generate the corresponding tables in MySQL. 
We had to identify a suitable primary key, data types for all attributes and constraints needed on the tables or columns. In the final phase of the project, 
we were required to build the database management system and populate the database with data to test the functionality of the program. 
The ide used for this project was Net Beans.
